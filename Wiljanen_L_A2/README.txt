source files: Game.cpp, Game.h, gameLog.txt, input.txt, Level.cpp, Level.h, Main.cpp, Mario.cpp, Mario.h

No errors

Refrences:
I used an online debugger for the first half of the project to try and fix errors, however it was very uneffective
since I had to copy and paste code continuously so I didnt get much out of it and ultimately ended up figuring out
how to debug in vscode. I still thought I would include this since it is a website I tried to use for help. Linked below.

Also used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-number-to-string-in-cpp/ to look up the to_string() function

Running instruction:
g++ *.cpp -o A2.exe
./A2.exe "input.txt"
