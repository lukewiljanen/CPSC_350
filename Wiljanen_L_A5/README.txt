My dad helped me work through some of the logic on paper to understand at which node the mosters are being inserted.
I refrenced some of the BST code we did in class to help with some of the design for the tournament tree
Used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/substring-in-cpp/ to look up how to substring and how to convert a string into an
integer to get the scream power level from the input file.
